Parsival robot code
===================


This repository contains the code for Parsival robot.
Parsival is a humanoid robot built using the Robonova platform.
The servos controller has been changed by an Arduino Mega and a Pololu Maestro.
The different movements are received through an X-Bee connected in the Arduino board.
A X-Bee remote sends the different movements to Parsival.
The remote is based on an Arduino Leonardo board.

Repository Content
-------------

The content of the different folders is the following

#### parsival_controller
This is the code for the remote controlled (Arduino Leonardo)

#### parsival_robot

This is the code for the Arduino Mega that controls Parsival servos

#### parsival_robot_pc_debug

This folder contains the code of a program that simulates the instructions executed in the Parsival code. It can be a start point for a Parsival simulator

#### parsival_movement_creator

This folder contains a python script that can be used to create the code for the different Parsival movements

Create a new movement
-------------------

Lots of movements are already available for the Robonova robot, so we'll try to use them as a base for the Parsival movements.

Parsival movements:
Parsival has 3 types of movements:


TimedPose
:   This movement makes the robot to reach the wanted joints position all at the same time. The movement describes a sinusiod form (it starts slowly, reaches the max speed at the half and slows down until the final position is reached.

DirectPose
:   This movement sends the final position to the servos inmediatly and does not control their position, so the servos reach the final position the fastest they can

StaticTimePose

:   The robot does not move for a specific time.



Lets take as an example the Turn Right movement and transform it to a Parsival movement:

The movent as written in the roboBASIC lenguage is as following:
```
right_turn:
	SPEED 6
	
	MOVE G6A,  85,  71, 152,  91, 112,  60  
	MOVE G6D, 112,  76, 145,  93,  92,  60 
	MOVE G6B, 100,  40,  80,    ,    ,    ,
	MOVE G6C, 100,  40,  80,    ,    ,    ,
	WAIT

	SPEED 9
	
	MOVE G6D, 113,  75, 145,  97,  93,  60
	MOVE G6A,  90,  50, 157, 115, 112,  60 
	MOVE G6C, 105,  40,  70,    ,    ,    , 
	MOVE G6B,  90,  40,  70,    ,    ,    , 
	WAIT   

	MOVE G6D, 108,  78, 145,  98,  93,  60
	MOVE G6A,  95,  43, 169, 110, 110,  60 
	MOVE G6C, 105,  40,  70,    ,    ,    ,
	MOVE G6B,  80,  40,  70,    ,    ,    , 
	WAIT
	
RETURN
```
First we need to compose the poses strings. The poses must be the secuence of positions the joints must reach in the order from the A port to the D port. All the values must be filled. The void values can be filled with 0.
Then, the above movement is translated into the following poses:
```
Pose 1: {85,  71, 152, 91, 112, 60, 100, 40, 80, 0, 0, 0, 100,  40,  80, 0, 0, 0, 112, 76, 145, 93, 92, 60}

Pose 2: {90,  50, 157, 115, 112, 60, 90, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 105,  40,  70, 0, 0, 0, 113, 75, 145, 97, 93, 60}

Pose 3: {95,  43, 169, 110, 110, 60, 80, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 105, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 108, 78, 145, 98, 93, 60}
```
Now we just need to create a JSON dictionary with the movement sequence.
We must choose for each pose the type of movement we want.
**The movement name can't contain white spaces and must start with a capital letter**.

The example below contains poses of all types as a reference.
The time is expressed in milliseconds.
```
movementTurnRight = {
    "name": "MovementTurnRight",
    "poses": [
        {
            "type": "TimedPose",
            "time": 200,
            "positions": "{85,  71, 152, 91, 112, 60, 100, 40, 80, 0, 0, 0, 100,  40,  80, 0, 0, 0, 112, 76, 145, 93, 92, 60}"
        },
        {
            "type": "TimedPose",
            "time": 100,
            "positions": "{90, 50, 157, 115, 112, 60, 90, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 105, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 113, 75, 145, 97, 93, 60}"
        },
        {
            "type": "DirectPose",
            "time": 0,
            "positions": "{95,  43, 169, 110, 110, 60, 80, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 105, 40, 70, 0, 0, 0, 108, 78, 145, 98, 93, 60}"
        },
        {
            "type": "StaticTimePose",
            "time": 100,
            "positions": ""
        }
    ]
}
```
> **Note:**

> - It is not written in the example but the  final **standard_pose** must also be added to the movement as if a new pose is, following the same principles described above.

Now that the movement is prepared, it can be added in the file
parsival_movement_creator/movement_code_creator.py

Simply add the above code and add the dictionary to the movements_list object.
Call the generation of the movements:
python parsival_movement_creator/movement_code_creator.py
And the new movements code should be created in their correct places. Upload to Parsival and test them.

Launch a movement in Parsival
-------------------
Parsival accepts strings in the form of '0' and a '1' in the position of the index of the movement that will be executed. The string must be terminated with an 'x'
The number of '0's and '1' must be equal to the number of movements available in Parsival.
This way, if we only have 2 movements, the accepted strings are:

* 10x -> executes the first movement
* 01x -> executed the second movement

To test the movements:

* Upload the code to parsival
* Open the serial interface
* Send the command string (01x or any other of an available movement)
